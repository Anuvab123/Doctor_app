Frameworks and Language Used:
-
The Doctor's App project is implemented using the Java programming language. Java is a widely adopted and highly versatile language that offers strong support for object-oriented programming. It provides a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. Java's key features include:
1. Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on dependencies and sensible defaults, reducing the need for manual configuration.
2. Embedded server: It includes an embedded web server (usually Apache Tomcat or Jetty) that allows you to run the application as a standalone executable JAR file.
3. Starter dependencies: Spring Boot offers a wide range of starter dependencies that provide pre-configured libraries for various functionalities, such as database connectivity, security, and web development.
4. Spring MVC: It leverages the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for building web applications. Spring MVC provides robust support for handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, and rendering views.


Data Flow:
-
1. The Doctor's App project follows a typical client-server architecture, where the web application acts as the client, and the Spring Boot server serves as the backend. The data flow within the application involves several components and follows a series of steps to perform various operations, such as creating appointments, retrieving patient records, and updating medical information. The following sections outline the high-level data flow for some of the key features.

2. The client (web application) sends a request to the server to create a new appointment. The request contains the necessary details, such as the patient's information, appointment date, and time.

3. The server receives the request and forwards it to the appropriate controller in the Spring MVC framework.

4. The controller validates the request data and performs any necessary business logic. It may interact with other components, such as services or repositories, to process the request.

5. The controller communicates with the appointment service, which handles the creation of the appointment. The service may perform additional operations, such as checking for conflicting appointments or updating the patient's appointment history.

6. The service interacts with the appointment repository to store the appointment data persistently in the database.

7. The repository saves the appointment details in the database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

8. Once the appointment is successfully created, the server sends a response back to the client, confirming the creation of the appointment.
